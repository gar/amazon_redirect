amazon_redirect
===============

Chrome extension which redirects you from Amazon.com to the same book page on Amazon.co.uk.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, when viewing a product on Amazon.com, you may want to view the same product on the Amazon.co.uk site. This Chrome extension will place a small UK flag in the URL bar when you are on an Amazon.com site. Clicking that flag will attempt to find the product with the same ASIN on the Amazon.co.uk site.

This is a first pass at this extension. Please submit an issues you find.
